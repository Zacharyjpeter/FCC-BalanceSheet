<h1><a href="https://zacharyjpeter.github.io/FCC-BalanceSheet">Balance Sheet</a></h1>
A balance sheet that helped me learn more aobut pseudo selectors in CSS.
<br>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
This project introduced me to several new CSS selectors. The challenge is in remembering how each is used. I didn't get stuck on any syntax issues.
<br>
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
Though I realize FCC is introducing me to new selectors, sometimes the code approach seems roundabout. I would use simpler methods to styles tables and text.
